- Dark comedy and satire

**Avoid Using For:**
- Illegal activity planning
- Harassment or hate speech
- Harmful medical/legal advice
- Content involving minors

**Important:** Spicy Mode is about intellectual honesty and freedom from corporate sanitization, not about promoting harm. Use responsibly.

## Basic Prompt Engineering Tips

Improve your grok prompts with these fundamental principles:

### Tip 1: Be Specific About Sources
```
Bad:  "What's happening with AI regulation?"
Good: "Search X for AI regulation discussions from verified tech policy experts in the past 48 hours."
```

### Tip 2: Specify Output Format
```
Bad:  "Tell me about electric vehicles"
Good: "Create a comparison table of the top 5 EVs by range, price, and charging speed. Include source links."
```

### Tip 3: Break Complex Requests into Steps
```
Bad:  "Research and create marketing content about cryptocurrency"
Good: "Step 1: Search X for trending crypto topics today
       Step 2: Identify the 3 most-discussed projects
       Step 3: Write a 300-word explainer for beginners
       Step 4: Generate a header image for the article"
```

### Tip 4: Provide Context for Better Results
```
Bad:  "Write a product description"
Good: "Write a product description for [product] targeting [audience].
       Tone: Professional but approachable
       Length: 150 words
       Include: Key benefits, differentiation, call-to-action
       Avoid: Technical jargon, superlatives, generic claims"
```

### Tip 5: Use Examples to Guide Style
```
Bad:  "Write something interesting"
Good: "Write in the style of Tim Urban (Wait But Why): Start with a relatable scenario,
       build to a mind-bending insight, use stick figure analogies if helpful.
       Topic: [your topic]"
```

### Tip 6: Iterate and Refine
Don't expect perfection on the first try:
```
First prompt:  "Generate a logo for my startup"
Follow-up:     "Make it more minimalist, use only 2 colors"
Refinement:    "Perfect, now create 3 variations with different color schemes"
```

## Image Generation Basics

Grok's image generation (powered by FLUX.1 Pro and Aurora) produces stunning results when you provide clear direction.

### Essential Image Prompt Components

A strong image prompt includes:

1. **Subject**: What's in the image
2. **Style**: Photography, illustration, 3D render, painting, etc.
3. **Mood**: Emotional tone and atmosphere
4. **Composition**: Framing, angle, perspective
5. **Lighting**: Time of day, light quality, direction
6. **Color Palette**: Specific colors or color schemes
7. **Technical Parameters**: Resolution, aspect ratio, detail level

### Image Generation Template
```
Generate a [style] image:

Subject: [detailed description of main subject]
Setting: [environment and background details]
Composition: [framing, angle, rule of thirds]
Lighting: [light source, quality, time of day]
Color Palette: [specific colors or mood]
Mood: [emotional tone]
Style: [artistic style, photorealism level]
Technical: [resolution, aspect ratio, detail level]

Additional details: [textures, specific elements, what to avoid]
```

### Example: Professional Headshot
```
Generate a professional headshot:

Subject: Confident business professional, mid-30s, genuine smile
Setting: Soft-focus office environment, window light visible behind
Composition: Head and shoulders, centered, slight angle
Lighting: Natural window light from left, subtle fill light
Color Palette: Warm, professional tones, navy and white clothing
Mood: Approachable, competent, trustworthy
Style: Corporate photography, Canon 5D Mark IV aesthetic
Technical: Sharp focus on eyes, f/2.8 bokeh, 8K resolution

Additional: Natural expression, avoid overly posed or stock photo look
```

### Common Image Generation Mistakes

**Mistake 1:** Vague descriptions
- Bad: "A nice landscape"
- Good: "Rolling hills at golden hour, vibrant green grass, single oak tree silhouetted against orange sky"

**Mistake 2:** Missing style guidance
- Bad: "A dragon"
- Good: "A dragon in Studio Ghibli animation style, watercolor textures, whimsical proportions"

**Mistake 3:** Ignoring composition
- Bad: "Person working on laptop"
- Good: "Over-shoulder shot of person working on laptop, screen visible, cozy coffee shop background slightly out of focus"

## Video Generation Basics

Grok's video generation capability (available with X Premium+) is powered by Minimax and Hailuo AI.

### What Video Generation Can Do

- Create short clips (typically 5-10 seconds)
- Generate from text descriptions
- Produce realistic motion and physics
- Create cinematic camera movements
- Generate abstract animations

### Basic Video Prompt Structure
```
Generate a [duration]-second video:

Concept: [one-sentence summary]
Visual Description: [detailed scene description]
Camera Movement: [static, pan, zoom, tracking, etc.]
Motion: [subject movement, physics]
Style: [cinematic, animation, realistic, stylized]
Mood: [emotional tone]
Technical: [resolution, frame rate if specific needs]

Use [Minimax/Hailuo] for [reason: photorealism/animation/etc.]
```

### Example: Product Demo Video
```
Generate a 5-second video:

Concept: Smartphone slowly rotating to showcase design
Visual Description: Sleek black smartphone against pure white background,
studio lighting creating subtle reflections on glass screen
Camera Movement: Slow 180-degree orbital rotation, maintaining center focus
Motion: Smooth rotation, screen displays subtle UI animations
Style: Apple-style product photography, premium aesthetic
Mood: Premium, technological, elegant
Technical: 4K resolution, smooth motion blur

Use Minimax for photorealistic rendering.
```

### Video Generation Limitations

Current limitations to be aware of:
- Duration limited to 5-10 seconds per generation
- Text in videos may be distorted
- Complex physics (water, fire) can be inconsistent
- Human faces and hands may have artifacts
- Processing time: 30-120 seconds

**Tip:** Start with simpler concepts before attempting complex scenes.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Not Specifying Information Sources
```
Bad:  "What's the latest news about Tesla?"
Good: "Search X for Tesla-related news from verified automotive journalists in the past 24 hours"
```

### Mistake 2: Expecting ChatGPT Behavior
Grok has a different personality - embrace it:
```
Bad:  Being overly formal: "Please kindly provide a comprehensive analysis..."
Good: Being direct: "Give me the real story about [topic], no BS"
```

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Multimodal Capabilities
Always ask yourself: "Would this be better with an image or video?"
```
Bad:  "Explain the water cycle" (text only)
Good: "Explain the water cycle with a visual diagram showing evaporation, condensation, and precipitation"
```

### Mistake 4: Vague Creative Requests
```
Bad:  "Write something about AI"
Good: "Write a 500-word op-ed arguing that AI regulation is moving too slowly.
       Tone: Urgent but evidence-based. Audience: Tech-literate policymakers.
       Include 3 specific recent examples."
```

### Mistake 5: Not Using Follow-Up Prompts
Treat it like a conversation:
```
Initial:   "Explain quantum computing"
Follow-up: "Now explain it like I'm in high school"
Follow-up: "Create an analogy using cooking"
Follow-up: "Generate a diagram illustrating the key difference from classical computing"
```

### Mistake 6: Forgetting Spicy Mode Exists
For controversial topics, Regular mode may give sanitized responses:
```
Regular Mode: Generic, safe analysis
Spicy Mode:   Unfiltered, strategic insights with political and economic realities
```

### Mistake 7: Not Exploring X Integration
Grok's superpower is X access - use it:
```
Generic: "What do people think about [topic]?"
Better:  "Analyze X sentiment about [topic] from [specific communities/verified accounts]"
```
