## 1. Daily Priority Optimizer

**Category:** Time Management
**Difficulty:** ⭐
**Works with:** All Grok tiers

> I have these tasks for today: [list tasks]. Help me prioritize using multiple frameworks: 1) Eisenhower Matrix (urgent/important quadrants), 2) Impact vs Effort analysis, 3) Time-blocking schedule (with energy levels - when am I most/least productive?), 4) MIT (Most Important Tasks) - identify top 3 that would make today successful, 5) Task dependencies (what must happen first). For each task, estimate realistic time needed, identify potential obstacles, and suggest optimal time of day. Create a realistic schedule with buffer time, breaks, and flexibility for unexpected issues. Include decision rule for when new tasks arise.

**Why it works:** Multiple prioritization methods prevent single-framework bias. Energy consideration improves task-time matching. Realistic scheduling with buffers reduces stress. These grok prompts create actionable daily plans.

**Variations:**
- "Weekly planning with big rocks, pebbles, sand analogy"
- "Sprint planning for project milestone achievement"
- "Monthly goal breakdown into weekly actions"
- "Multi-project juggling with context-switching minimization"

## 16. Decision Automation Rules

**Category:** Mental Clarity
**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐
**Works with:** All Grok tiers

Examples: "If meeting has no agenda, decline"; "If email can be answered in 2 minutes, answer immediately"; "If item costs less than $X and will save Y hours, buy without deliberation". Create personal rulebook reducing decision fatigue and increasing consistency.

**Why it works:** Decision rules free mental bandwidth for important choices. Consistency improves outcomes. Exception handling maintains flexibility. Grok prompts create operating system for life.

**Variations:**

## 17. Information Diet Design

**Category:** Cognitive Health
**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐
**Works with:** Grok Premium

> Optimize information consumption for productivity and wellbeing. Audit: 1) Current information sources (news, social media, email, podcasts, books, etc.), 2) Time spent on each, 3) Value received (learning/entertainment/connection/inspiration), 4) Cost paid (attention, anxiety, distraction), 5) Passive vs active consumption, 6) Signal-to-noise ratio. Design healthier diet: 1) Eliminate (low-value, high-cost sources), 2) Reduce (valuable but over-consumed), 3) Maintain (good balance), 4) Increase (underutilized high-value), 5) Consumption rules (when, how long, for what purpose), 6) Input processing (how to capture and use information), 7) Creation vs consumption balance, 8) Detox periods (information sabbaticals). Create weekly information plan with time budgets and quality filters.

**Why it works:** Audit reveals unconscious consumption patterns. Cost-benefit analysis drives better choices. Creation balance prevents pure passivity. These grok prompts protect attention.

**Variations:**
- "News consumption strategy (stay informed without overwhelm)"
- "Social media boundaries (connection without addiction)"
- "Professional learning diet (systematic skill development)"
- "Creative input curation (inspiration without comparison trap)"
