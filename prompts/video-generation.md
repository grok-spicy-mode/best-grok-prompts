## 1. Social Media Product Teaser

**Category:** Marketing & Advertising
**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐
**Works with:** Grok Premium | Spicy Mode

> Create a 15-second vertical video showcasing [product name]. Start with a close-up of the product, then pull back to show it in use. Use dynamic camera movements, vibrant colors, and end with the product logo appearing with a subtle animation. Background: modern minimalist setting. Mood: energetic and aspirational.

**Why it works:** This prompt provides clear structure (beginning, middle, end), specifies technical requirements (15 seconds, vertical format), and sets the visual tone. Grok responds well to structured video requests with defined camera movements.

**Variations:**

- Specify music: "upbeat electronic background music at 110 BPM"

## 2. Educational Explainer Animation

**Category:** Education & Training
**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐
**Works with:** All Grok tiers

> Generate a 30-second animated video explaining [concept] to beginners. Use simple geometric shapes and characters. Show the concept through visual metaphors: [describe metaphor]. Use a whiteboard animation style with smooth transitions. Include 3-4 key text labels that appear sequentially to reinforce learning points.

**Why it works:** Educational grok prompts benefit from simplification requests and clear pacing. The whiteboard style is computationally efficient while remaining engaging.

**Variations:**
- "Use isometric 3D style instead of 2D whiteboard"

## 3. Cinematic Brand Story

**Category:** Branding & Storytelling
**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐
**Works with:** Grok Premium | Spicy Mode

> Create a 45-second cinematic video telling the origin story of [brand/company]. Scene 1 (0-15s): Sunrise over [location], symbolizing new beginnings, shot with wide-angle lens. Scene 2 (15-30s): Close-ups of hands working, creating, building - shallow depth of field. Scene 3 (30-45s): Final product/service in action, happy customers, pull back to reveal brand logo. Color grade: warm, golden hour tones. Transitions: smooth cross-dissolves.

**Why it works:** Breaking down the video into scenes with timestamps helps Grok maintain narrative coherence. Cinematography terms (wide-angle, shallow depth of field) guide visual style effectively.

**Variations:**
- "Black and white with selective color on brand elements"
- "Add inspirational quote overlays at 15s and 35s"
- "Include subtle parallax effect on background elements"

## 4. Before-and-After Transformation

**Works with:** All Grok tiers

> Generate a split-screen video showing before-and-after of [transformation]. Left side: "before" state in muted, desaturated colors. Right side: "after" state in vibrant, saturated colors. Duration: 20 seconds. Include a vertical divider line that swipes from left to right at 10 seconds to reveal the transformation. Add "BEFORE" and "AFTER" labels at top corners.

**Why it works:** Split-screen comparisons are highly effective for Grok's video generation and provide immediate visual impact. Simple structure ensures clean execution.

**Variations:**
- "Use slider/wipe transition instead of split-screen"
- "Add numerical stats appearing next to each side (% improvement)"

**Why it works:** Logo animations benefit from particle-to-form narratives that Grok handles well. Specifying export requirements ensures usability.

**Variations:**

- "Glitch effect transition for tech brands"
- "3D rotation revealing logo from different angles"

**Why it works:** These grok prompts work by focusing on supporting footage rather than dialogue, which plays to AI video generation strengths. Natural, documentary style is more forgiving of imperfections.
